## 2. Executive Summary
BrandKit is a B2B-focused digital platform (web and mobile app) that enables corporate offices, event organizers, and similar clients to design, preview, and order custom-branded promotional items such as welcome kits (e.g., bags, pens, water bottles, diaries, t-shirts). The platform acts as an aggregator, connecting clients with a network of wholesale vendors specialized in each product category. Clients upload logos or designs, visualize products in real-time, place orders, and receive fulfilled products, while BrandKit earns commissions (10-15%) per order without handling inventory or production.

**Vision**: To become the go-to one-stop platform for customizable promotional merchandise in India, starting with Gujarat-based operations, streamlining B2B procurement and fostering vendor ecosystems for scalable, efficient branding solutions.

**Business Goals**:
- Achieve 100 active corporate/event clients within the first year.
- Generate ₹50 lakhs in annual revenue through commissions.
- Expand to pan-India operations by Year 2, with potential for B2C segments.

**Key Differentiators**:
- Real-time 3D/360° product previews with uploaded logos.
- Aggregator model ensuring competitive pricing and no minimum order quantities (MOQs) for clients.
- Focus on B2B welcome kits and event bundles, with recurring order features.

This PRD outlines the minimum viable product (MVP) requirements, prioritizing core features for launch, while identifying future enhancements.

## 3. Market and User Analysis
### 3.1 Market Opportunity
The Indian custom promotional products market is valued at ~₹6,000 crore (USD 731 million) in 2024, growing at 7.8% CAGR, driven by corporate branding, events, and e-commerce. B2B segments (e.g., employee onboarding kits) account for ~40% of demand, with Gujarat's manufacturing hubs (Ahmedabad, Surat) providing vendor advantages. Post-COVID, digital procurement has surged, with 60% of corporates preferring online platforms for customized items.

WEBSITE Design Details

The website’s desktop frontend styling follows a clean, template-driven visual structure with a strong reliance on modern sans-serif typography that prioritizes readability over character, using consistent font weights and sizes but with limited typographic contrast for strong visual hierarchy; layouts are predominantly grid-based and sectioned vertically, creating a predictable flow with moderate whitespace that keeps the UI uncluttered yet slightly dense in some areas. Imagery is high-resolution and sharp, occupying large containers to create visual impact, though animations are minimal and mostly limited to basic hover states or simple fade-in effects rather than advanced motion design or micro-interactions. The overall design quality is functional and consistent, with uniform color usage and alignment, but it lacks premium detailing such as layered depth, nuanced shadows, or dynamic visual transitions that elevate high-end interfaces. UI components load in a generally acceptable timeframe on desktop, though the absence of visibly aggressive lazy-loading or skeleton loaders suggests performance optimization is moderate; image-heavy sections may introduce some CLS risk if dimensions are not strictly reserved, while metrics like LCP and FID would likely fall into an average range for small-to-mid-scale websites rather than optimized benchmarks. Scrolling behavior is straightforward and linear, without parallax, sticky animated transitions, or scroll-triggered storytelling effects, which keeps usability simple but visually static. Overall, the frontend styling delivers clarity and consistency, but remains conservative—favoring reliability and ease of use over expressive design, advanced animation, or cutting-edge performance-driven UI techniques.
